# IDE and editor support

* [Visual Studio Code extension](https://github.com/ursalang/ursa-vscode) (very basic for now: just syntax colouring)
* [Emacs mode](https://github.com/ursalang/ursa-ts-mode) (available from [MELPA](https://melpa.org/#/ursa-ts-mode)); needs tree-sitter support, which is included in Emacs 29 and later
* GEdit, the GNOME Text Editor and other programs that use GtkSourceView: [GtkSourceView patterns](https://github.com/ursalang/ursa-gtksourceview)
