# Step 2b: Why do we (still) need programming languages?

Thanks to machine learning, we no longer need programming languages to tell computers what to do: for many applications it’s possible to talk to a computer and have it interpret one’s natural language. So why do we still need programming languages?

* **Understanding natural language still requires a lot of processing power.** Typically today we do it by using online services that run in data centres full of powerful computers.
* **Natural language is ambiguous**. For programs that we want to rely on to run without human supervision, programming languages are more reliable.
* **Programming is fun**. Just like other formal systems, whether the wide world of mathematics or the microcosm of chess, programming is fun as an intellectual exercise. But it can have real-world effects: you can program machines that do things in the world. Instructing machines to do things is a rewarding and powerful way to relate to the human world.
