# Ursa tutorial

*Under construction.*

Ursa is meant to be a simple, friendly language. This tutorial tries to help you learn to program, as well as to learn Ursa. In its current version, it will doubtless be woefully incomplete, so please do [report](https://github.com/ursalang/ursalang.github.io/issues) things that are unclear or missing (or wrong!).

Also, see the [language reference](../reference.md).
