## Getting started

Like any skill, programming is something best learnt by doing it, so this tutorial includes lots of programming challenges. Each one is presented in a “playpen” where you can type code and see what it does, a goal (suggested answer), and a “solution” tab, which shows you one way to get the answer. Do try each exercise yourself before looking at the solution! Here's an example:

$include{../tutorial-step.html}

<script src="/tutorial.bundle.js"></script>
