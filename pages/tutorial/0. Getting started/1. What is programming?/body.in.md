# Step 1: What is programming?

Before we get stuck into learning Ursa, we should consider: what is programming?

Programming is an act of communication. Most obviously, we instruct the computer what we want it to do. Less obviously, we tell other humans—other programmers—what we’re trying to accomplish. Programming is as much about reading as it is about writing; indeed, we typically spend more time reading code than we do writing it; and certainly more time reading documentation.
