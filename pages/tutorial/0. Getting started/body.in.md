# Chapter 0: Getting started

Like any skill, programming is something best learnt by doing it, so this tutorial includes lots of programming challenges. Each one is presented in a “challenge” widget, which contains the following elements:

* The “playpen” tab, where you can type code and see what it does
* A “goal” (suggested answer)
* The “solution” tab, which shows you one way to get the answer
* The “result" area shows the result value of your code
* The “output” area shows the output of your code

Do try each exercise yourself before looking at the solution!

Here’s an example:
$include(../tutorial-step.html)

From time to time there will be a $run(note.in.py,bonus button,Don’t worry\, bonus boxes are optional!) which when clicked on will open a box with supplementary material.

$run(next-step.in.py,1. What is programming%3F/,What is programming?)
<script src="/tutorial.bundle.js"></script>
