# Contribute

Ursa is a big project that is advancing on many fronts. We welcome contributions!

The best place to start is probably to improve something you wish was better. Do [get in touch](discussion.md), have a look at our [roadmap](roadmap.md), join us on [GitHub](https://github.com/ursalang) and file [bugs](bug_reports.md).

Another excellent way to contribute and learn Ursa at the same time is to add more examples of Ursa to Rosetta Code; see the [Tasks not implemented in Ursalang](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Tasks_not_implemented_in_Ursalang) page.
